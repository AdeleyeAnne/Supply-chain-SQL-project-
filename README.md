# Supply-chain-SQL-project-
This dataset was initially analyzed using Power BI and Excel. To deepen my understanding and broaden the scope of analysis, I further explored the data using SQL, focusing on query-based insights and hands-on data manipulation.

### ✅ Summary of Analysis
This comprehensive supply chain analysis explored product performance, inventory, customer demographics, manufacturing, and supplier efficiency using a dataset covering sales, stock, delivery, and costs.
